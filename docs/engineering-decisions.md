# Engineering Decisions — Family Finance Command Centre v2

## Format
Each entry records: what was decided, why, and what rule it produced.
Logged in chronological order. Never edited — only appended.

## [2026-05-18] Started from scratch — requirements first

**Context:**
Version 1 was built mock-data-first. UI was built before the database existed.
This caused structural debt that could not be patched: hardcoded constants,
currency-unaware formatters, RLS gaps, duplicate transactions, module-level
calculations that ran before data loaded.

**Decision:**
Rebuild from scratch using the correct order:
Requirements → Data model → RLS policies → Services → Hooks → UI

**Rules derived:**
- Never write a React component before its data layer is verified in Supabase
- Never use mock data in any file that will exist in production
- Never hardcode a financial value — it must come from Supabase

## [2026-05-18] Renamed 'household' to 'budget centre'

**Context:**
The app is not only for households. Users can create budget centres for
Airbnb properties, businesses, overseas residences, or any named financial
context. Calling everything a 'household' was misleading and caused confusion
in the UI and data model.

**Decision:**
The core financial unit is called a 'Budget Centre' throughout the app,
database, and code. Users name their centres whatever they want.

**Rules derived:**
- Never use the word 'household' in new code
- Database tables: budget_centres, budget_centre_members
- Context: BudgetCentreContext
- Hooks: useBudgetCentre

## [2026-05-18] Dual SELECT policies on every financial table

**Context:**
In v1, budget_categories had only a member-based SELECT policy.
The owner could not read their own categories immediately after creation
because the member row did not yet exist. This caused a silent empty
result that looked like a bug.

**Decision:**
Every financial table has TWO SELECT policies:
1. Member-based: is_budget_centre_member(centre_id)
2. Owner-based: is_budget_centre_owner(centre_id)

This ensures reads work at every stage of the lifecycle.

**Rules derived:**
- When adding a new table, always add both policies before writing any service code
- Test both policies with the Supabase role impersonation tool before shipping

## [2026-05-18] Unique constraint on income transactions at database level

**Context:**
In v1, duplicate income transactions were created because the application-level
idempotency guard checked in-memory state. On page reload, memory was empty
so the guard passed and duplicates inserted.

**Decision:**
Enforce uniqueness at the database level with a partial unique index:

  create unique index transactions_income_unique
  on transactions (budget_centre_id, category_name, amount, date)
  where type = 'income' and deleted_at is null;

**Rules derived:**
- Data integrity is enforced at the database level, not in application code
- Application-level guards are defence-in-depth only, never the primary protection
- Any record that must be unique needs a database constraint

---

## [2026-05-18] Soft deletes only — never hard delete financial data

**Context:**
Financial records must be auditable. A deleted transaction must be recoverable.
Hard deletes permanently destroy audit trails.

**Decision:**
All tables with financial data have a deleted_at column.
Deletes set deleted_at = now(). All queries filter where deleted_at is null.
No hard deletes ever on financial data.

**Rules derived:**
- Never write DELETE FROM on a financial table
- Always use UPDATE ... SET deleted_at = now()
- RLS policies have no DELETE policy — hard deletes impossible via the API

## [2026-05-18] Currency formatting via makeFmt — never hardcoded

**Context:**
In v1, fmt was hardcoded to GHS. Every user saw GHS regardless of their
budget centre currency. This was discovered only after the app was built.

**Decision:**
makeFmt(currency) creates a formatter per budget centre when the centre loads.
The formatter is stored in BudgetCentreContext and accessed via context hook.
No component ever imports fmt directly from lib/finance.js.

**Rules derived:**
- makeFmt is the only way to format currency in the app
- fmt is always read from context, never imported directly
- No component hardcodes a currency symbol or currency code

---

## [2026-05-18] Auto-trigger creates user profile on signup

**Context:**
In v1, the users table row had to be created manually after auth.
This caused race conditions where auth succeeded but profile reads failed.

**Decision:**
A Supabase trigger on_auth_user_created automatically creates:
- A public.users row with id, email, name
- A public.user_preferences row with default theme and notification settings

**Rules derived:**
- Never manually insert into users from application code
- The trigger is the single point of user creation
- Application code only reads and updates the user row, never inserts it

---

## [2026-05-18] Transaction currency defaults to centre currency

**Context:**
In v1 the currency was hardcoded to GHS on every transaction.
Users should never be forced to select a currency on every log entry.
But transactions can be in a different currency to the centre (e.g. overseas expense).

**Decision:**
Transaction currency defaults to the budget centre currency — pre-filled in the form.
The user can override it for individual transactions if needed.
The currency is stored on each transaction row for future conversion support.

**Rules derived:**
- Always pre-fill currency from the active budget centre
- Never force the user to select currency on every transaction
- Always store the original currency on the transaction — never assume centre currency
